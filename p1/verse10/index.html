    <p>And then it's just too much, the streets, they still run with blood<br />
    A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here<br />
    And Lord, don't let me break this, let me hold it lightly<br />
    Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly, <a href="../index.html">yeah</a></p>
