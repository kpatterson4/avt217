    <p>I let him sleep, and as he does<br />
    My held breath fills the room with love<br />
    Hurts in ways I can't describe<br />
    My heart bends and breaks so many, many times<br />
    And is born again with each sunrise<br />
    And is born again with each <a href="../verse7/index.html">sunrise</a></p>
