    I believe in you and in our hearts we know the truth and
    I believe in love and the darker it gets, the more I do
    Try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light
    And the days will become endless and never, and never turn to night
    And never, and never turn to <a href="verse2/index.html">night</a>
