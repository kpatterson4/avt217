    <p>I believe in you and in our hearts we know the truth<br/>
    And I believe in love and the darker it gets, the more I do<br/>
    Try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light<br/>
    And the days will become endless and never, and never turn to night<br/>
    And never, and never turn to <a href="../verse2/index.html">night</a></p>
